ShortStories
============
This is where I keep all my writing. It's not very good yet, but I hope it will get better with time. Constructive criticism is appreciated, but definitly not expected considering this is the Internet after all.

Progress
=========
"Tempo" is almost finished and is definitely my best work so far (which isn't saying much).
"Cured" needs work, but is at least still coherent.
"Revelation Blues" is basically unreadable at this point.



Disclaimer
============
These are all works of fiction. All characters appearing in these works are ficticious. All resemblence to persons living or dead, is coincidental.

Also, it should be noted that the views of the characters displayed within these stories are not my views. I made them up. It doesn't mean I agree with them.

Finally, all damage done to your eyesight is your own responsibility.
