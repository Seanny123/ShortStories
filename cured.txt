Cured (UNDER CONSTRUCTION. COME BACK IN A WEEK)

Abby's hair blows in the wind as we walk in the park beside her apartment, it's long straight bands dishevelled by nature. It's a superficial distraction to focus on, but I don't care, it's easier than accepting what I'm about to lose.
 
“It’s like you’re only half-there all the time,” Abby says. "Honestly, what do you want Tony? What do you care about?" It hurts more than it should given how many times this type of confrontation has happened before.
"Well, I was hoping to see a movie with you," I say, "but that doesn't seem to be an option anymore." 
She sighs, so I guess that means that I win. At least that's what I keep telling myself as I walk home and collapse into a puddle of self-pity on my couch with a bag full of candy.

"Those are those 'Comfort Candies' aren't they?" my room-mate Jad says, throwing himself on the couch beside me. "In the year we've lived together, I've never seen you eat those jujubes with a smile on your face."

It's one in the morning, but Jad's still in the mood to talk. He has a poly-phasic sleep cycle which means he sleeps something like four hours a day in half hour chunks.

His foot taps out the same rhythm that I usually hear when he's in front of a whiteboard solving some problem. He reaches into his pocket and takes out a stress ball, branded with the logo of some start-up I've never heard of. He rolls it between his hands with the same ceremony as a therapist asking you to lay down on the couch.
"Given the evidence presented before me," he says, "I'm going to hypothesize that Abby broke up with you." Some people use "Divide and Conquer" as a method to solving computer problems. Jad uses it as his life's motto.
"She says we drifted apart over the summer," I say, "because we were so far away. Now, she says it wasn't just the distance and the problem is I'm not 'emotionally responsive' enough. What does that even mean?"
"Why didn't you ask her?"
"I prefer clean and quick break-ups. Do you think I'm 'emotionally unresponsive?"
"Do you want the honest answer?"
I grab another handful of jujubes in preparation. "Hit me."
"You don't connect emotionally with other people and I doubt you even know how to connect with yourself."
"I connect with myself the same way everyone else does. One hand on the mouse, the other hand on my..."
"First point. You don't seem to be able to imagine anyone complexly."
"What? I understand people."
"When I introduced you to my friend Dev, you said he smelled pretty good for a hippy."
"It was a joke. Also, I've never met a person with dreadlocks who wasn't a hippy."
"Second point. What is it you are actually working towards? You hate your studies and you've never mentioned any side projects."
“Why do I need 'work towards something'? And even if you're right about these 'problems', what can I do about them anyways?”
"Okay. One question at a time. There's nothing wrong with being happy. As to what you can do about it...  What is it you want to achieve?"
"Closure?"
"Do you think she's right?"
"No..."
"I think our old friend the scientific method could help here."
"Our friend?"
"What if you tried being a more caring person? You know, fake it until you make it and analyse the results."
"How do I even fake that?"
"You can try cognitive behaviour therapy.”
“That sounds like something out of a self-help book.”
“Or there might be something we can print.”

I like that idea a lot better.

Jad is the only owner of a bio-printer in our city and maybe even in our country. From what I understand, there a lot of fancy compounds in the world made out of basic materials that are easily acquirable. If you get that material, you can print it into whatever you want. The LSD he printed out for us last week is just carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen. How you get from code to the LSD, I'm not so clear on, but as long as the LSD keeps working, I'm not too worried.

Jad taps on his phone a few times and I hear the bio-printer start in his bedroom. I smell the usual synthetic aroma coming from the printer, except this time with a unique hint of strawberry.

"Some researchers in Austria found this compound that enhances the amount of empathy you feel," Jad says, "which is basically what you're lacking."
"I'm guessing the only side effect is spontaneous tentacle production?" I say.
"Check it out for yourself."

With another tap, he sends me the research papers. They seem legitimate as far as my high school knowledge of biology is concerned.
"Okay," I say, "but I'm stopping as soon as things get too weird."
"Of course", says Jad, smiling reassuringly.

It first sneaks up on me a couple of days later when I'm sitting in Ecology class. We're talking about these tropical frogs that went extinct and a ball of emotion starts to build in my chest. I feel the despair that would come with being of the last of your species, unable to understand why everything you've ever known is coming to an end. To know without a doubt that there is no future left. The prof says that this tragedy is due in part to our carnivorous diet, which encourages the deforestation of the Amazon. Despite my heart swelling with righteous indignation, the best thing I can come up with is choosing a veggie burger for lunch.

I notice it again when I get a coffee from Timmie's on my way home. The cashier is sluggish, but upon further examination, I can tell she's just having a rough day. I decide to try to cheer her up.

I blurt out once I reach the front of the line, "Your earrings are really nice... And you are doing a good job."
"Thanks?" she says.

I'm not sure about what to do next, so I grab my coffee and speed walk out the door.

I'm so excited by this experimentation that for a moment I forget Abby... But only for a moment. I don't think it's possible to make a pill that untangles the mess of a breakup.

I tell all of this to Jad while we eat dinner.

"It's like I've discovered this sixth sense that I didn't know I had. I can feel what other people are feeling. And I care. Like deeply care in a way I didn't know that I was missing."

"Just be careful you don't get exploited," he says while drinking his meal replacement shake.

That night, I don't crave the lol-cats and videos of epic fails as much as I usually do, so I start Googling all these things that I kept being told I should care about, but seemed unimportant at the time. Along the way, I find out that my vegetarian meal didn't help the frogs much and that the problem is way more complicated. Normally, pre-medication me would just accept the world is doomed at this point, but now I just want to know the truth, no matter how elusive it might be.

My first over-reaction happens while I'm eating lunch with my friend in the cafeteria on campus. In the movie we're watching, a group of people trapped on a subway car are hurtling towards the end of the track. Just when you think they're about to become human pancakes, the fail-safe on the track catches them and they're all saved. Tears of relief start streaming down my face.

"Are you okay?" my friend asks cautiously.
I try to look for an escape route, but come up blank. "Yeah. I'm fine," I croak, trying to wipe the tears from my face.
"Is it the breakup? Do you want to..." he pauses before entering unfamiliar territory, "talk about it?"  He asks as, questioning the very concept of the question.

I cycle through the plausible options desperately, "Yes. No. Maybe? I... I have to go." I rush out of the caf, looking for a wash-room where I can regain my composure.

The next day on my way home, there's another student trying to get donations for a charity.

"Hey, do you have a minute?" she asks, earnestly concerned that I might be too busy.
"Sure." I don't, but I can't bring myself to walk past her.

She's not very convincing, but all it takes is one photo of a starving child to vacuum out my wallet. I have to sell my iPod so I can eat for the next month, seeing as I'm too embarrassed to ask my parents for money.

That night, I can't sleep. My mind keeps conjuring up the girl, her excitement and eagerness at convincing someone to be involved in something that she cares so much about. Abby's questions drill themselves in parallel into my brain. What do I want? What do I care about? My nihilistic counter-arguments, usually strong and impenetrable, are now flat and unimaginative.

The next morning, Jad knocks on my door to give me the pills for the next week, I flip him off without turning away from my textbook.

"Fuck caring. I want my old life back."
Jad is taken aback, "What? We just got started."

"This shit..." I turn around like a James Bond villain, but clutching my depression jujubes instead of petting a cat, "has gotten too ridiculous. I'm crying at movie endings that aren't even sad."
"We'll lower the dose some more."
"When people ask me for charity donations, my wallet becomes a liability."
"I'm sure a lower dose will fix those problems."
"No, fuck it Jad, I need my apathy to function. I used to be happy. Now, I'm having existential crises at night, which I thought something only emo kids did." 
"So your priorities are re-aligning. Isn't this what you wanted?"
My voice approaches hysteria. "Maybe, but I still wanted to know who the hell I was. I DON'T EVEN LIKE THESE FUCKING JUJUBES ANYMORE!" I shake the bag in front of me accenting my confusion.
"Come on don't give up now!"

Although Jad does give suggestions from time to time, he has always let me choose the path of my life. He would work like crazy on his projects and I would mess around on the Internet. The only reason he would be trying to shove these pills down my throat is...

"Hey," I say, "I know! Let's see if the people who wrote the papers did any other work on the potential sociological effects of the drug." Jad starts to explain, but I ignore him, turning back to my computer to open the research paper. I grab the name of the first researcher and plug into Google.

Just as I thought, zero relevant results. Jad sighs behind me.

"You son of a bitch!" I get up off my chair and throw the jujubes to the ground,
"You've been waiting all along for me to be vulnerable and now you're killing me for one of your fucking experiments!"
"I would hardly call increased motivation and emotional awareness fatal..."
"You don't know what the long term effects are!"
"Please, you make it sound like I didn't try it on myself first."

That stops me in my tracks.

"Why are you taking these things?" I ask as my fist unclenches.
"I needed to test the fix before I spread it to a wider audience." 
"What? Are you planning to sneak it into the water supply like some super-villain?"
"Actually, I was thinking the campus coffee machine might be the more practical vector of propagation."
"I'm not even going to try and counter that. Jad, the pills have made you completely insane and I am getting the hell out of here."

To his credit, Jad doesn't try to stop me as I rush through our living room and slam the door.

I start sleeping at my friend's place for the next few days, since my muscles clench in anger every time I consider going back to my apartment. Post-empathy is a weird state of being. I used to care about all these things, but now I can close my bubble and just focus on myself. I know what I should do technically, but I just decide that doing nothing sounds more appealing. I can't decide if this is an improvement.

One day while taking a meandering route home, I notice the office of a chaplain on campus. I start going by his office every day and much to my dismay, he's actually there one of the days I walk by.

Stripped of my excuses, I stand there awkwardly at the door of his office while he frowns over papers. Eventually, I decide that there is no non-awkward way to start this conversation.

"Is this where I can talk about ethics and stuff? You know, somewhere I can get some answers?"

He's old, but carries a warm smile. "Ideally yes, but I can give no guarantees." He gestures towards the chair in front of him. I reluctantly take a seat.

"How," I ask, "do you deal with the contradiction that every moment you live, you should be helping reduce the humongous amount of suffering in the world, but at the same time, you don't."
"I'm lucky enough to be in a position where I can every day. But not everyone feels the call that I did, so I guess all you can do is to try your best."
"But the apathy stops you. So, you should get rid of the apathy, but if you do, that opens a whole new can of worms."
"Right. Apathy is a useful defence against many things, but I guess if you were really thoughtful that wouldn't be a problem."
"What if, hypothetically, you could take a pill that made you more emotionally sensitive to other people's suffering. Would you take it?"
"Of course. Assuming that it has no ulterior cost."
"But it's hard being empathetic. It tires you, it forces you to do things you're not comfortable with."
"Sounds like a move in the right direction to me."
"But it's not-natural. And it stops you from being happy."
"What's your natural state like?"
"Hypothetically?"
"Hypothetically."
"It sucks. I know that I would find meaning in caring, but I can never make the first step, so I just keep drifting. And that's my ideal natural state. Maybe I'm just bad at being a human being."
"Who said that who we are naturally is ideal."
"Well, God?", I can't believe I'm the one using this argument.
"That's not a very good justification. A lot of what we do and a lot of what makes human society interesting isn't natural. Look at how the Internet basically became the nervous system of our planet. That is completely human-made."
"So I should keep taking the pill. The hypothetical pill, I mean. Thanks."
I get up to leave, but just as I reach the threshold he asks me one more questions.
"What circumstances is the pill compensating for? Are you happy where you are? Did your life have meaning?"

When he phrases it that way, it makes the answer pretty simple. "No," I concede, "definitely not." 

I'm taking a shortcut back home through the engineering building when I hear someone crying in one of the computer labs. My body freezes in resistance, but I fight through it and go talk to her. She's bent over her keyboard, her arms hiding her face.

"Hey," I say, "do you need someone to talk to?"

She looks up. Fuck. It's my ex. She got a haircut and I didn't recognize her.

"Are you kidding me?" she's less than pleased to see me.

Since there's no dignity to salvage at this point, I might as well be honest. "Would you believe me if I told you 'no'?"

"Yeah," she says, "I need someone to talk to, but honestly, you're the last person I want to explain my problems to. Even when we were together you weren't that great at the serious stuff."

"Humour me. I'm trying to turn over a new leaf. That, and your only other option at this point is the guy playing Starcraft behind you."

She lets out a weak laugh and then lets her shoulders slump, "Fuck. It's so silly now that I say it out loud, but my grandmother is in the hospital. It's not that serious. She just has to get some surgery and there's a two percent chance that she'll die, but I keep thinking about how that's almost the same chance as picking card from a deck and I'm not ready to lose her. We've never been that close, but she still loved me and now I'm wondering maybe the fact that we aren't that close is mostly my fault. It's just this vicious cycle of morbidity and guilt. Honestly, I probably just need to get out of this lab and go for a walk." She wipes her tears with the sleeve of her sweater. "God, who the fuck cries in public when they're this old?"

"Well, recently me..."

"Seriously?" She's smiling now. Would pre-drug me miss a smile?

"What the fuck happened?" she says.

My muscles tighten in my chest initially, but I tell myself that this is what empathetic people do. They share.

"After you broke up with me, I wondered if what you said had some truth in it, so Jad proposed a little experiment..."

By the time I'm finished, she looks like she's trying to decide between punching me and hugging me. She wisely opts for neither.

"Can you get me a supply of the pill from Jad?"
"What?"
"Right, you're pretty pissed at Jad right now. I guess I can just contact Jad myself."
"The fuck? Why do you want to take the pill?"
"Most of the reason I can't talk with my grandmother is the generational gap. She keeps gossiping about her neighbours, when all I really want to hear about is what she thinks about life, having lived this long. I think with the pill would help."
"But it sucks being on the pill. It makes you unhappy."
"What's so bad about unhappiness? Maybe you just don't know how to handle it."
"Hypotheses are usually a good place to start."

A silence settles as the weight of my realization weighs down on me. Abby interrupts it.

"Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a calculator to program in Assembly and no amount of empathy is going to help me understand it."
I nod and get up to leave. "Right. Good luck."

"Hey."
He takes a few steps away from me as I approach him.
"Hey." he says.
"Listen, about the pills. I've been thinking..." that's when the smell of strawberries hits me from his backpack.
"Wait. Jad, what's in your backpack?"
"Computer. What?"
"I can smell that you printed something."
"Just some LSD for my friends later."
"Bullshit. The LSD smells different. You printed out more of the pill."
"This doesn't involve you. You don't need to worry about it."
"Are you going to try and sneak into the coffee?"
"Why do you care? You don't drink coffee."
"Give me the bag Jad."
I make a grab for it, but Jad punches me in the face. I fall on the ground cringing and expecting more blows, but instead I hear sobs.
"Three mother fucking years. Three fucking years and nothing's changed."
"What?"

"Maybe it doesn't work. Maybe you can't change a person."

I start to laugh.

"What?"
"I hate you, but it worked for me. I'm changed and I know if I want to keep changing I'll have to work at it. That's why I don't want you to fucking spread it in the coffee. I mean, yeah it's stupid, illegal and crazy, but it also won't work. The pill doesn't give you super-powers, it makes you weak. It's up to you what to do with it. If you don't let people choose, then they won't change."
"You call taking a vegetarian meal a significant change?"
"Of course not. That's just sympathy, but you have to start somewhere before you can change it into empathy and action."

I put my hand on my jaw and it explodes in fiery pain.

"Speaking of turning empathy into action, can you drive me to the walk-in clinic. I think you broke my jaw."
"No, it's just bruised. I would know if I broke it. Also, you probably wouldn't be talking right now. Let's go home and get you some ice."
"You don't have some magic un-bruising pill?"
"I do, but it makes your balls fall off."
"Oh god, why..."
"I was joking."

As we walk home, I realize that this might be the first time I've ever felt excited by the uncertain blank slate provided by the future.

Why I wrote this story:
It asks a lot of questions I've been thinking about. I don't really have any answers except for the one at the end where the best that you can do is test hypotheses. So I thought a story would be a cool way to start a conversation and I'd like to hear what other people think about this.

Problems:
This might still be boring.
