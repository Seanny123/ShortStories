Cured

I've already heard what Abby is saying from a dozen other people, so I focus on her long hair blowing in the wind. It's a superficial distraction, but I need it. I don't want to have to confirm that something I care about deeply is ending right in front of me.
 
“It’s like you’re only half-there all the time.” Abby says, exasperated. "Honestly, what do you want Tony? What do you care about?" 
"Well, I was hoping to see a movie with you, but that doesn't seem to be an option anymore.", I joke. She sighs, so I guess that means that I win. Or at least that's what I keep telling myself as I walk home and collapse into a pit of self-pity on my couch with a bag full of candy.

"Those are those jujubes you only eat when you're depressed aren't they?" my roomate Jad says throwing himself on the couch beside me, "I've never seen you eat those things with a smile on your face."

It's one in the morning, but he's still in the mood to talk. He has a poly-phasic sleep cycle where he sleeps something like four hours a day in half hour chunks.

His wiry frame barely makes a dent in the couch cushion and he's jittery like he usually is when he's planning something. He reaches into his pocket and takes out his stress ball, rolling it between his hands like a therapist starting a timer.
"Given the evidence presented before me, I'm going to hypothesize that Abby broke up with you." he says.
"She says that we drifted apart over the summer when we were on different sides of the country and now that I'm back, she understands that it wasn't just the distance. She says that I'm not 'emotionally responsive' enough. What the fuck does that even mean?"
"Why didn't you ask her?"
"It's hard to think when your heart is shattered. Do you think I'm 'emotionally unresponsive'?", I dare to ask, making an uncomfortable amount of eye contact with him to read his expression.
"Ah, well... Do you want the honest answer to that question?", he replies, continuing to stare straight ahead at the slapstick comedy movie posters adorning our wall.
I grab another handful of jujubes in preparation.
"Hit me."
"I'm assuming that by 'emotionally unresponsive', she means that you don't connect emotionally with other people and she probably doubts that you even know how to connect with yourself."
He holds up a finger to silence me before I can make a masturbation joke.
"Let's start with the first point. You don't seem to be able to sympathize with anyone or to imagine anyone complexly."
"What? I understand people."
"You look for one defining feature and then you assume that's their entire definition. The first thing you said after I introduced you to my friend Dev was that he smelled pretty good for a hippy."
"It was a joke. Also, I've never met a person with dreadlocks that wasn't a hippy. So what, I made one flash judgement. It's not like I told you he wasn't allowed in our apartment anymore."
"As for the second point, the matter of self-connection, I've never heard you discuss the future. What are you looking forward to? And you can't say the next episode of..."
My anger and I decide to interrupt him. “Wait. Why do I need a plan? What if I'm happy as I am right now? What if I am a little bit self-centered sometimes? Isn't everyone? Even if it is a problem, what the hell can I do about that?”
"Okay. One question at a time. There's nothing wrong with being happy, you're the one that asked about improvement in the first place. As to what you can do about it...  What is it you want to achieve anyways?"
"Closure? I want to see if she's right, I guess. "
"Do you think she's right?"
"No?"
"I think our old friend the scientific method could help here. What if you tried being a more caring person? You know fake it until you make it or can at least compare before and after."
"How?"
"You can try cognitive behaviour therapy.”
“That sounds like something out of a self-help book.”
“Or there might be something we can print.”

I like that idea a lot better.

Jad is the only owner of a bio-printer in our city and maybe even in our country. As the name says, it prints out organic material. Basically, there a lot of fancy compounds in the world that are made out of basic materials that are easily acquirable and so if you get that material you can print it into whatever you want. The LSD he printed out for us last week is just carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen. How you get from code to the LSD, I'm not so clear on, but as long as the LSD keeps working, I'm not too worried.

When I asked how legal it was, he said that it wasn't illegal... yet. That was good enough for me.

Jad taps on his phone a few times and I hear the printer start in his bedroom.

"Some researchers in Austria found this compound that enhances the amount of empathy you feel, which is basically what you're lacking.", he smiles reassuringly.

I'm still hesitant so he sends me some research papers later to back up his claims and they seem legitimate. The next morning, I start taking the pills with bizarrely adorable cartoon cat faces on them.

I was never one to fall for the placebo effect so I don't feel anything for a few days. It first sneaks up on me when I'm sitting in Ecology class. We're talking about these frogs that went extinct. I really start to <i>feel</i> for these frogs. I start imagining what it would be like to be one of the last of your species, unable to understand why everything you've ever known is ending. The prof says that this tragedy is due in part to our increasingly carnivorous diet, which encourages the deforestation of the Amazon. So when I go for lunch that day, I go for the vegetarian option.

I notice it again when I get a coffee from Timmie's on my way home. I notice the cashier is moving really slowly. Upon further examination, I can tell the cashier is probably just having a rough day and could use something to cheer her up.

"Your earrings are really nice... And you are going a good job." I blurt out once I reach the front of the line.
"Thanks?" she says.

I'm not sure about what to do next, giving compliments to strangers is pretty unfamiliar territory for me, so I grab my coffee and speed walk out the door.

I'm so excited by this experimentation that for a moment I forget Abby and the breakup... But only for a moment. Oh well, I don't think it's possible to make a pill that instantly fixes the clusterfuck that is a breakup.

I tell Jad this while I eat my dinner.

"It's like I've discovered this sixth sense that I didn't know I had. I can feel what other people are feeling. And I care. Like deeply care in a way I didn't know was possible or that I was missing."

"Just be careful you don't get exploited." He says while drinking his meal replacement shake.

That night, I don't crave the click trance as much as I usually do, so I start Googling all these things that I knew I should wonder about, but didn't because of apathy. I find out that my vegetarian meal probably didn't help the frogs much and that the problem is way more complicated. Normally, pre-medication me would just tell the world to fuck off at this point, but now I just want to know the truth, no matter how elusive it might be.

And then it starts to get weird. The first over-reaction is when I'm eating lunch with my friend Ryan on campus. In the movie we're watching, a group of people trapped on a subway car are hurtling towards the end of the track. Just when you think they're about to become human pancakes, the fail-safe on the track catches them and they're all saved. Tears of relief start streaming down my face.

"Are you okay?", Ryan asks cautiously.
I try to look for an escape route, but come up blank. "Yeah. I'm fine.", I croak, trying to wipe the tears subtly from my face.
"Is it the breakup? Do you want to...", he pauses before entering unfamiliar territory, "talk about it?" He asks as if he is questioning me and the very concept of the question at the same time.

I cycle through the plausible options desperately, "Yes. No. Maybe?",  before I decide to settle on the absurd, "I... I have to go." I mutter as I rush out of the room.

The next day on my way home, there's another student trying to get donations for a charity.

"Hey, do you have a minute?", she asks, earnestly concerned that I might be too busy.
"Sure." I don't, but my enhanced empathy won't let me just walk past her.

She's convincing enough to vacuum out my wallet. I have to sell my iPod so I can eat for the next month, seeing as I'm too embarrassed to ask my parents for money.

That night, I can't sleep. I keep thinking about the girl and how she's doing something she cares about and how she's helping people. What am I doing? My usual nihilistic counter arguments won't work against my conscience tonight.

The next morning, Jad knocks on my door to give me the pills for the next week, I flip him off without turning away from my textbook.

"Fuck caring. I want my old life back."
He's taken aback. "What? We just got started."

"This shit...", I turn around like a James Bond villain, but clutching my depression jujubes instead of petting a cat, "has gotten too ridiculous. I'm crying at movie endings that aren't even sad."
"We'll lower the dose some more."
"When people ask me for charity donations, my wallet becomes a liability."
"I warned you about the possibility of being exploited, but I'm sure a lower dose will fix those problems."
"No, fuck it Jad, I need my apathy to function. I was happy before. I knew what I wanted. Now, I'm having existential crises at night, which I thought something only emo kids did." 
"So your priorities are re-aligning. Isn't this what you wanted?"
My voice approaches hysteria. "Maybe, but I still wanted to know who the hell I was. I DON'T EVEN LIKE THESE FUCKING JUJUBES ANYMORE!", I shake the bag in front of me accenting my confusion.
Jad pleads "Come on don't give up now!"

Slowly, I start to connect the dots.

"Give up? Dude, this is my body, my life and it's only an experiment. Why do you care about this so much?"
He stays quiet.

"You son of a bitch!", I get up off my chair and throw the peaches to the ground, "Those research papers were faked weren't they? You've been waiting all along for me to be vulnerable to exploit me and now you're killing me for one of your fucking experiments!"
"I would hardly call increased motivation and emotional awareness fatal..."
"You don't know what the long term effects are!"
"Please, you make it sound like I didn't try it on myself first."

That stops me in my tracks.

"How long have you been taking these things." I ask as my fist unclenches.

"Right. You've only been my roommate for a year, so you don't know what I was like before. To say I was materialistic is to insult the scale of the greed that I possessed." 

"What changed?"

"My epiphany came to me in the same way that all epiphanies do. Painfully. I witnessed a violent event, that I'm sure you'll understand, I can't relate to you right now without crying due my heightened state of emotional vulnerability. Let's just say that this senseless act disturbed me to my core. I knew stuff like that happened on the news, but to see it portrayed in front of me was... disturbing. So I started looking for a solution to the inherent violence of humanity. So that led to bio-printer, which led to this."

"What were you going to do? Sneak it into the water supply like some super-villain?"

"Actually, I was thinking the coffee machine might be the more practical vector of propagation."

For the first time in a while, I'm able to bring my emotions under control. "I'm going to speak slowly and carefully, because I want you to understand every word I say. I cannot explain how bad of an idea that is. I would report you to some authority, but the pills haven't totally worn out, so my brain is telling me to give you the benefit of the doubt and hope that you'll understand that what you're trying to do is incredibly stupid."

"Oh. And I'm obviously moving out. Now."

I move quickly, leaving all my food there and packing just enough so I can start sleeping on the floor of one of my friend's room while I try to find another place. To his credit, Jad doesn't try to stop me as I rush through our living room and slam the door in angry futility.

Post-empathy is a weird state of being. I used to care about all these things, but now I can close my bubble and just focus on myself. I know what I should do technically according to the things I felt during that week, but I just don't do it. I can't decide if this is an improvement.

One day while taking a meandering route home, I notice the office of a padre on campus. I start going by his office every day. Much to my dismay, he's actually there one of the days I walk by.

Stripped of my excuses, I stand there awkwardly at the door of his office while he frowns over papers. Eventually, I decide that there is no non-awkward way to start this conversation.

"Is this where I can talk about ethics and stuff? You know, somewhere I can get some answers?"

He's old and white. Somewhere in his 60s. "Ideally yes, but honestly no one seems to want to hear the answers I'm giving these days." He gestures towards the chair in front of him. I reluctantly take a seat.

"How do you deal with the contradiction that every moment you live, you should be helping reduce the humongous amount of suffering in the world, but at the same time, you don't.", I ask.

"Well, I try and I think everyone should too."

"But it's the apathy that stops you. So you should get rid of the apathy, but if you do, that opens a whole new can of worms."

"Right. Apathy is a useful defence mechanism against people who want to take advantage of you, but I guess if you were really thoughtful that wouldn't be a problem."

"So what if hypothetically, you could take a pill that made you more emotionally sensitive to other people's suffering. Would you take it?"

"Of course. Assuming that it has no ulterior cost."

"But it's hard being empathetic. It tires you, it forces you to do things you're not comfortable with."

"Sounds like a move in the right direction to me."

"But it can't be right? It's un-natural. And it stops you from being happy."

"Who said that who we are naturally is ideal."

"Well, God?", I can't believe I'm the one using this argument.

"That's not a very good justification. A lot of what we do and a lot of what makes human society interesting isn't natural. Look at how the Internet basically became the nervous system of our planet. That is completely human-made."

"So I should keep taking the pill. The hypothetical pill, I mean."

"You could also ask yourself what circumstances is the pill compensating for? Are you happy where you are? Did your life have meaning?"

When he phrases it that way, it makes the answer pretty simple. "No.", I concede childishly, "Definitely not." 

"That's probably the first problem you should address."

I'm taking a shortcut back home through the engineering building when I hear someone crying in one of the computer labs. I think about what the padre said, how now I have no idea what I'm doing and that any random step at this point must be a bit of a step in the right direction, so I go talk to him.

"Hey, do you need someone to talk to?"

It's actually a girl. She looks up. Fuck. It's my ex. She got a haircut and I didn't recognize her. In my defence, she's always been an oddly manly crier.

"What the actual fuck? Are you fucking kidding me?", she's less than pleased to see me.

I decide that since there's no dignity to salvage at this point, I might as well be honest. "Surprisingly no."

"Yeah, I need someone to talk to, but honestly, you're the last person I want to explain my problems to."

"Is it about us? Or me? I guess I can't say 'us' anymore."

"No," she says, "It's not all about you, you know.". To be fair, I do tend to usually think it is. Her shoulders slump. "Fuck. It's so silly now that I say it out loud, but my grandmother is in the hospital. It's not that serious. She just has to get some surgery and there's a 1 in 6 chance that she'll die, but I keep thinking about how that's the same chance as rolling a dice and I'm not ready to lose her. We've never been that close, but she still loved me and now I'm wondering maybe the fact that we aren't that close is mostly my fault. It's just this vicious cycle of morbidity and guilt. Honestly, I probably just need to get out of this lab and go for a walk." She wipes her tears with the sleeve of her hoodie. "God, who the fuck cries in public when they're this old?"

"Well, recently me..."

"Seriously?" She's smiling now. Is it normal to miss a smile?

"What the fuck happened?", she says.

She's always been my favourite person to tell stories to, so I tell her.

"After you broke up with me, I wondered if what you said had some truth in it, so Jad proposed a little experiment..."

By the time I'm finished, she looks like she's trying to decide between punching me and hugging me. She wisely opts for neither.

"Can you get me a supply of the pill from Jad?"
"What?"
"I guess not Jad, you're pretty pissed at him right now. Someone else then."
"The fuck? Why do you want to take the pill?"
"Yeah. Most of the reason I can't talk with my grandmother is the generational gap. She keeps gossiping about her neighbours, when all I really want to hear about is what she thinks about life, having lived this long. I think with the pill will help me understand her."
"But it sucks! It makes you unhappy."
"Maybe you just don't know how to handle it. Honestly, what are you thinking of doing now, if you're so convinced that your present life doesn't have any meaning."
"I don't know volunteer?"
"C'mon. Do you think that's really going to change anything? What would really turn shit around?"
"Oh god. I need to drop out. Everything else is hypotheses, but I know I can't keep studying crap I don't care about."
"Hypotheses are usually a good place to start."

Why I wrote this story:
It asks a lot of questions I've been thinking about. I don't really have any answers except for the one at the end where the best that you can do is test hypotheses. So I thought a story would be a cool way to start a conversation and I'd like to hear what other people think about this. Also, I know Tony says a lot of stupid things, like grouping Africa as one place with a single economic situation, but that's because he is kind of stupid. Like me.

Problems:
This might still be boring.
The self-reflection takes too long.
Actually, this whole damn story is too long.
