Cured

When life kicks me in the nuts, I buy a pack of fuzzy peaches and eat them as slowly as possible. Eating as a means to overcome emotions has a long and storied tradition, but unlike the other people binging to fill a hole inside of them, my end goal is a bit different. I want to feel the gelatin stick to my gums and the sugar leak down my throat. I want a concrete reminder that no matter how much life sucks right now, there is beauty in this world.

It�s in this state, on the couch (as the tradition dictates), that Jad finds me. 

He cocks an eyebrow before throwing himself on the seat beside me. "Those are the depression peaches aren't they." he says pointedly. "What�s wrong?�

It's one in the morning, but he's still in the mood to talk. That motherfucker has a poly-phasic sleep cycle where he sleeps something like four hours a day in half hour chunks.

Instead of answering, I change the subject. "Doesn't sleeping every two hours kind of screw with your social life?"

He shrugs. "It does if you don't have that part of your life optimized."

"Optimized?"

"A lot of your friends don't match your personality and aren't driving you to be the best that you could be."

"I think you have a different definition of friends than I do."

His wiry frame barely makes a dent in the couch cushion. He reaches into his pocket and takes out his stress ball, rolling it between his hands, like a therapist starting a timer.
"So I'm guessing she broke up with you."
"YAH DON'T SAY." I reply with a mouthful of peaches, so it comes out more like �Yadonnamshay!�.
"And it wasn't pretty either." he says while grabbing his own handful.
I force a lump down my throat.
"Well, she was at least considerate enough to not do it in front of her roommates. She suggested that we go for a walk before we caught the bus for the movie. That's when she started the whole fucking monologue."

I unintentionally replay it in mind for a split second, allowing my internal editing committee to highlight the cringe worthy moments: 
I've heard the same speech so many times before that I focus on her long hair blowing in the wind, so that I don't have to confirm that something I cared deeply about was ending right in front of me. 
�It�s like you�re only half-there all the time.� Touch�. "Honestly, what do you want Tony? What is it that you care about?" "Well, I was hoping to see a movie with you, but that doesn't seem to be an option anymore.", I joke. She sighs, so I guess that means I win.

Back in my shitty apartment, my stomach tightens itself painfully and it�s not because of the peaches.

"Care to give me a quick synopsis?", the scrunch of his stretch ball is oddly soothing.
"She says that we drifted apart over co-op and now that I'm back, she understands that it wasn't just the distance. She said that I'm not emotionally responsive enough. What the fuck does that even mean?"
"Why didn't you ask her?"
"It's kind of hard to think rationally when your heart has shattered."
"Sounds a bit melodramatic."
"I think I've earned a bit of self-pity right now."

He lets that sentence hang in the air and settle on the ground deposited with the rest of my ego and dignity. As weird as Jad is, he knows when silence is necessary.

"Am I 'emotionally unresponsive'?", I dare to ask.
"Ah, well... Do you want the honest answer to that question?"
I grab another handful of peaches in preparation.
"Hit me."
"Well, you don't seem to be able to sympathize with anyone. You don't try to imagine anyone complexly. You look for one defining feature and assume that is their entire definition."
"What? I understand people."
"The first thing you said after I introduced you to my friend Dev was that he smelled pretty good for a hippy."
"I've never met a person with dreadlocks that wasn't a hippy."
"Well, you would've if you bothered to talk to him."
"So what, I made one flash judgment. I'm a pretty tolerant person. It's not like I told you he wasn't allowed in our house anymore."
"Admittedly summaries are necessary when analyzing people, but you abuse the privilege. Also, I've also never heard you discuss the future. Like why the hell are you in university anyways?"
"Because I don't want to starve."
"You don't starve on welfare."
"But you don't live that well either."
"Okay, let me put this another way. What are you looking forward to? And you can't say the next episode of that brainless sitcom that you watch."
I'm starting to get annoyed at this personal critique.
�Wait why do I need a plan? What if I'm happy as I am right now? And what if I am a little bit self-centered sometimes? Isn't everyone? What the hell can I do about that?�
"Okay. One question at a time. There's nothing wrong with being happy, you're the one that asked and that wanted to improve. As to what you can do about it... You can try cognitive behavior therapy.�
�That sounds like something out of a self-help book.�
�Or there might be something we can print.�

I like that idea a lot better.

Jad is the only owner of a bio-printer in our city, possibly our province. As the name says, it prints out organic material. The printer can print out all sorts of wonderful things that I can barely understand. I mean, I get the idea. There a lot of fancy compounds in the world that are made out of basic materials that are easily acquirable and so if you get that material you can print it into whatever you want. The LSD he printed out for us last week is just carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen. But how you get from code to the LSD, I'm not so clear on, but as long as the LSD keeps working, I'm not too worried.

When I asked how legal it was, he said that it wasn't... yet. And just to be safe, I should just pretend I never saw it.

"Some researchers in Austria found this compound that enhances the amount of empathy you feel, which is basically what you're lacking. It couldn't hurt." he smiles at the idea of experimentation.

He sends me some research papers later to back up his claims and they seem legitimate, so I start taking the pills with bizarrely kawaii cat faces on them the next morning.

I was never one to fall for the placebo effect so I don't feel anything for the first few days, but then I'm sitting in Ecology and we're talking about these frogs that went extinct and I just really start to <i>feel</i> for these frogs. I start imagining what it would be like to be one of the last of your species, unable to understand why everything you've ever known is ending. The prof says that this is due in part to our increasingly carnivorous diet, which encourages the deforestation of the Amazon. So when I go for lunch that day, I go for the vegetarian option at the cafeteria.

When I get a coffee from Timmie's on my way home, I can tell the cashier is having a rough day and I want to help her through it.

"Your earrings are really nice." I blurt out.
"Thanks?" She says uncertainly.

I grab my coffee and speed walk out the door.

I tell Jad this while I eat my dinner of instant ramen.

"It's like I've discovered this 6th sense that I didn't know I had. I can feel people. I can feel what they're feeling. And I care. Like deeply care in a way I didn't know was possible or that I was missing."

"Just be careful you don't get exploited." He says while drinking his meal replacement shake.

That night, I'm motivated and full of caring and I don't crave the brain-dead click trance as much as I usually do, so I start Googling all these things that I had always put off because of apathy. I find out that my vegetarian meal probably didn't help the frogs much and that the problem is way more complicated. Normally, this would frustrate me, but now I just want to know the truth.

By the end of the week, the novelty has worn off and I'm angry. When Jad knocks on my room door to give me the pills for the next week, I flip him off without turning away from my textbook.

"Fuck caring. I want my old life back."
He's taken aback. "What? We just got started."

"This shit..." I turn around like a James Bond villain, but clutching my depression peaches instead of petting a cat. "has gotten too ridiculous. I was watching 'The Taking of Pelham 123' right at the end where the subway stops just in time and I almost burst into tears."
"We'll lower the dose some more."
"And then some lady from Unicef started asking me for donations while I was walking home and I gave her everything in my wallet while choking back sobs."
"I warned you about the possibility of being exploited, but I'm sure a lower dose will fix those problems."
"No, fuck it Jad, I need my apathy to function. I was happy before. I knew what I wanted. Caring about things took that away from me. I'm having existential crises at night. Before this, I thought existentialism was just something emo kids worried about." 
"So your priorities are re-aligning. Isn't this what you wanted? To care, to want to have a plan?"
My voice approaches hysteria. "Maybe, but I still wanted to know who the hell I was. Am I still Tony? Does Tony still exist? I DON'T EVEN LIKE THESE FUCKING PEACHES ANYMORE!"
Jad pleads "Come on don't give up now!"
Slowly, I start to connect the dots.

"Give up? Dude, this is my body, my life. I'm giving up on an experiment. Why do you care about this so much?"
He stays quiet. No philosophical arguments this time.

"You son of a bitch." I get up off my chair and throw the peaches to the ground. "Those research papers were faked weren't they? You're killing me for one of your fucking experiments!"
"I would hardly call increased motivation and emotional awareness fatal..."
"You don't know what the long term effects are!" I jab my finger accusingly at him.
"Please, you make it sound like I didn't try it on myself first."

That stops me in my tracks.

"Wait. How long have you been taking these things." I ask as my fist unclenches.

"You've only been my roommate for a year, so you don't know what I was like before. To say I was materialistic is to insult the scale of the greed that I possessed. I got absorbed into startup culture and venture capitalism, because I wanted to be rich. Because the man with the most money at the end wins. My parents were..." he pauses to find the right word "concerned... but I rejected their beliefs and felt stronger as a result, like most adolescents do."

"What changed?"

"My epiphany came to me in the same way that all epiphanies do. Painfully. I witnessed a violent event, that I'm sure you'll understand, I cannot relate to you right now without crying due my heightened state of emotional vulnerability. Now, it may be because I never played many video-games or watched much TV as a kid, but this act disturbed me to my core. I knew stuff like that happened on the news, but to see it portrayed in front of me was... disturbing. So I started looking for a solution. So that led to bio-printer, which led to this."

"What were you going to do? Sneak it into the water supply?"

He smiles slyly. "Actually, I was thinking the coffee machine might be the more practical vector of propagation."

For the first time in a while, I'm able to bring my emotions under control. "I'm going to speak slowly and carefully, because I want you to understand every word I say. I can not verbally articulate how bad of an idea that is. I would report you to some authority, but I don't know if anything you've done is actually illegal and I don't want to go through the legal bullshit and find out. Also, the pills haven't totally worn out, so my brain is telling me to give you the benefit of the doubt and hope that you'll realize the reasons why what you're trying to do is incredibly stupid and destructive."

"Oh. And I'm obviously moving out now."

I move quickly, leaving all my food there and pack just enough so I can start sleeping on the floor at one of my friend's place, until I can find another place. To his credit, Jad doesn't try to stop me as I rush through our living room and slam the door in angry futility.

Post-empathy is a weird state of being. I used to care about all these things, but now I can close my bubble and just focus on myself. I know what I should do technically according to the things I used to feel, but I just don't do it. I can't decide if this is an improvement.

I'm feeling so weird and outside of myself, that one day while walking home, I walk into the office of the padre that they have on campus.

I stand there awkwardly at the door of his office while he frowns over papers before I decide that there is no non-awkward way to start this conversation.

"Is this where I can talk about ethics and stuff? You know, somewhere I can get some answers?"

He's old and white. Somewhere in his 50s. "Well, ideally yes, but honestly no one seems to want to hear the answers I'm giving these days."

"How do you deal with the contradiction that every moment you live, you should be helping reduce the humongous amount of suffering in the world, but at the same time, you don't."

"Well, I try and I think everyone should too."

"It's the apathy that stops you. So you should get rid of the apathy, but if you do, that opens a whole new can of worms."

"I see what you mean. Apathy is a useful defense mechanism against exploitation, but I guess if you were really thoughtful that wouldn't be a problem."

"So what if hypothetically, you could take a pill that made you more emotionally sensitive to other people's suffering. You became more empathetic. Would you take it?"

"Of course. Assuming that it has no ulterior cost."

"But it's hard being empathetic. It tires you, it forces you to do things you're not comfortable with."

"Sounds like a move in the right direction to me."

"But it can't be right? It's un-natural. It's a modification of who we are. It's stops you from being happy."

"Who said that who we are is ideal."

"Well, God?" I can't believe I'm the one using this argument.

"That's not a very good justification. A lot of what we do and a lot of what makes human society interesting isn't natural. Look at how the Internet basically became the nervous system of our planet. How it extends us to the richest and the poorest people on earth with almost equal ease. That is completely human-made."

"So I should keep taking the pill. The hypothetical pill, I mean."

"You could also ask yourself what circumstances is the pill compensating for? Why can't you care normally? Are you happy where you are?"

When he phrases it that way, it makes the answer pretty simple. "Nope. Definitely not."

"That's probably the first problem you should address."

I'm taking a shortcut back home through the engineering building when I hear someone crying in one of the computer labs. I think about what the padre said and how now I have no fucking idea what I'm doing, so any random step must be a bit of a step in the right direction, so I go talk to him.

"Hey, do you need someone to talk to?"

And it's actually a girl. She looks up. Fuck. It's my ex. She got a haircut and I didn't recognize her.

"What the fuck? Are you fucking kidding me?" she's less than pleased to see me.

I decide that since there's no dignity to salvage at this point, I might as well be honest. "Surprisingly no."

"Yeah, I need someone to talk to, but honestly, you're the last person I want to talk to."

"Is it about us? Or me? I guess I can't say 'us' anymore."

"No. It's not all about you, you know." Although, I do tend to usually think it is. "Fuck. It's so silly now that I say it out loud, but my grandmother is in the hospital. It's not that serious. She just has to get some surgery and there's a 1 in 6 chance that she'll die, but I keep thinking about how that's the same chance as rolling a dice and I'm not ready to lose her. We've never been that close, but she still loved me and now I'm wondering maybe the fact that we aren't that close is mostly my fault. And it's just this vicious cycle of morbidity and guilt. Honestly, I probably just need to get out of this library and go for a walk. Get my mind off of this. God, who the fuck cries in public when they're this old anyways."

"Well, recently me..."

"Seriously?" She's smiling now. 

She's always been my favourite person to tell stories to, so I tell her.

"And now what?"

"Honestly, I'm thinking about dropping out of school. Maybe doing some volunteering. At first, my mind went to the typical going to volunteer in Africa, but there's a lot of stuff that you can do around here. The soup kitchen and the homeless shelter are always looking for volunteers. Oh, the food-bank too probably."

"Hold up. are you going to keep taking the drug or not?"

"I don't know. What do you think?"

"Well, it made you unhappy..." she shrugs.

"Is happiness the point to life? I mean, I guess you end up a slave to something no matter what you do and happiness really isn't so bad. So let's say it is the point of life. What I had going wasn't making me feel that happy. Taking the pill made me unhappy, but that was just because it took away my ability to appreciate the shallow things, I think. Fuck. I don't know. All I've got is hypotheses."

"Hypotheses are usually a good place to start."

Why I wrote this story:
It asks a lot of questions I've been thinking about. I don't really have any answers except for the one at the end where the best that you can do is test hypotheses. So I thought a story would be a cool way to start a conversation and I'd like to hear what other people think about this. Also, I know Tony says a lot of stupid things, like grouping Africa as one place with a single economic situation, but that's because he is kind of stupid. Like me.

Problems:
I think the encounter with the padre might be too coincidental or that I should bring him into the story beforehand. I don't like bringing and throwing away characters.
I also skipped over a large middle part, because I thought Tony recounting his experience through dialogue might be more succinct. Was I wrong to do this?
I also know that I've got too much dialogue standing on it's own, but I'll fix that after I get comments from you folk.
